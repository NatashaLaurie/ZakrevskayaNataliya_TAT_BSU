There are times when we question the things we know
We never thought that the cracks would begin to show
We both know love is not that easy
I wish I’d known that it would be this hard to be alone
Please, come home!
The loverless nights, they seem so long
I know that I’ll hold you someday
But until you come back where you belong
It’s just another lonely Sunday
Is this the end of the love that has just begun?
I always hoped that the best, it was yet to come
So please, come back, don’t you leave me
We’re both so young, I know you need me too
And there’ll always be times like these
The loverless nights, they seem so long
I know that I’ll hold you someday
But until you come back where you belong
It’s just another lonely Sunday

--The end--
